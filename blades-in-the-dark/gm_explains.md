# Front in DW / Apocalypse Games.

So let’s talk first about the role of the GM in DW/ Powered by the Apocalypse games.

So remember that the GM has a framework in DW (and other PbtA games): their Agendas and Principles. This isn’t just casual advice or “guidelines” that can be bent (they can sort of be bent, but that’s a story for another day). They are the rules for the GM, and they aren’t the “bad” kind of rules- the ones that seemingly restrict for no good reason. These are rules that will help you get as much out of the game as possible based on the game’s design and philosophy.

The GM Agendas are basically the designers’ way of saying: “GM, I want you to aim to accomplish these 3-4 things each and every session.” Most PbtA games share the same 3 Agendas, with degrees of variance:

    Portray the fictional world honestly

    Make the world come to life

    Play to find out what happens

That last one is the one that is almost ubiquitous to all PbtA games and is, interestingly enough, the most “confusing”- or at least- misinterpreted. “Playing to Find Out” is often erroneously conflated with “Never Prep and Improvise Everything and fly by the seat of your pants because the GM can’t know what’s going to happen.” That’s not what it means. In fact, there is a common Principle in nearly every PbtA game that says “Leverage your Prep”! So… how the hell to we leverage Prep but also “Play to Find Out”???!!!

Easy. We recognize that “Prepping” is NOT the same as “Planing.” What PbtA games want us to avoid is Planning. In other words, trying to push for outcomes we (as GMs) want and tweaking, fibbing, and altering play and rules to get a certain outcome. For example, if the PCs find a clever way to kill an Apocalypse Dragon and they friggin’ earned it- even if it was somehow just one dice roll- well… we, as GMs, shouldn’t “flip the script” and not give them their dues. The fiction and rules demand the Apocalypse Dragon has been stopped. We, as GMs, shouldn’t be “Planning” for the Apocalypse Dragon to stick around until we want it to be dead. We’re not authors. That’s not our Job.

Rather, we “Prepare the Problems, but never the outcomes, solutions, or plots.” That is the core of “Playing to Find Out.” These games are essentially the writer’s room of a TV Show, Movie, or Graphic Novel. We, as GMs, walk in with our Prepared Prompt for the writing team (the players). In this case? This time, we’re focusing on the Apocalypse Dragon! How will the characters of the show handle this grave threat??!! That’s their job to figure out (Hint: whatever the hell they come up with, no matter how hairbrained, so long as it is fictionally viable- it’s gonna be “the solution.”). Then we all play to find out how it all turns out.

But now the real question arises: how can we make sure that we are Prepping correctly? How can we get the most out of our Prep without stepping into Planning? The answer: Fronts.

Now, as far as I’m concerned, I don’t like Fronts. I don’t care for how they’re written and I use a far more simple system by just sticking with a very simple mix of Apocalypse World’s Threat Clocks (from which things like Fronts and other PbtA organizational tools have emerged), Impulse Drive’s Strains, and Blades in the Dark’s Clocks. Fronts are Dungeon World’s tools to help you Prep, but not Plan.

The Book gives examples for kinds of Fronts, but you can mix and match and use your own words. It’s a tool to help you organize your Prep. It’s a cheat sheet.

You have 2 kinds of Fronts:

    Adventure: Good for a session or two, maybe three

    Campaign: Good for multiple sessions, maybe five or more!

Fronts are comprised of Dangers. Dangers can be anything that is… well… Dangerous! The book gives you categories, but use whatever the hell you want to get your point across for your own Prep. If it’s dangerous- it can be part of your Front. These dangers always have a Drive: something they want. Hint: Many Dangers (and their Drives) can be sources right from the players because they’ll be feeding you snippets of the world based on their characters’ purviews. So things like:

    The Noble Family of Thanalax- Drive: To Conquer the Barony of Vawn to access the Magical Trees of the Whispering Woods (they’re the ones who made the Fighter’s Signature Weapon).

    The Merpeople Cult of Chlor- Drive: Unlock the Sacred Underwater Temple of Sod, the Prophet of Chlor (those waters are the favored Land of the Druid)

    The Cloud Riders of Lightning’s Fury- Drive: To bring ruin to the crops of the farming country of Uta for their alleged Sacrilege (The Paladin has sworn to protect these people)

These Dangers will eventually lead to something bad: an Impending Doom, usually closely connected to their Drive. On the way there, they (not the GM, per se) have a “Plan.” A series of fictionally logical steps that can be seen, felt, and experienced on the way to that Doom. These are the things that would logically occur in the fiction if the PCs did nothing about it. These are called the Grim Portents.

Danger: The Noble Family of Thanalax Drive: To Conquer the Barony of Vawn to access the Magical Trees of the Whispering Woods Grim Portents:

    The armies of Thanalax pass through the festering swamps, leaving ruin in their wake

    The armies of Thanalax stage themselves around the Southern Mountains, cutting off supply lines

    The General of Thanalax’s Great Army descends from the mountain to demand a Treaty or Surrender

    The Army Lays Siege to the Barony

Impending Doom: The Barony falls. Thanalax rules over them and has unbridled access to the woods

As time goes on:

    Maybe from a particular nasty 6- (or even an appropriate GM Move after a 7-9 or 10+…)

    Maybe after a Session is complete and Thanalax was ignored

    Maybe an encounter with Thanalax goes wrong

… The GM marks off a Grim Portent as the Danger reaches closer to the Doom. This is something seen and felt in the world and changes it.

What we do with this Prep is Play to Find Out if we ever reach that Doom. Perhaps the PCs interrupt them? How do their plans change? How does the world change? Hard to say… let’s play to find out how the episode/ season plays out.

Adventure Fronts, because they’re only for a session or two, usually don’t have a lot of Dangers and the Dangers don’t have much to accomplish to reach the Impending Doom

Campaign Fronts have more Dangers and more Grim Portents.

Sometimes Dangers conflict with each other and “race” for their impending doom. Sometimes one Danger “unlocks” another. It all depends on what you need for your Prep. Same idea with NPCs (with their own Drives), Custom Moves related to the Front, etc. It’s all just dressing on top.

Like I said, it’s a tool to organize your Prep, not a mandatory item of play. I personally don’t like determining Grim Portents beforehand. Rather, I make more “nebulous” Clocks and when “the time seems right,” I tick the Clock up and explain what that looks like in the fiction. The name of the Clock itself is usually enough to explain the impending doom (i.e. “Thanalax Conquers the Barony of Vawn”) and I keep that stuff open for the players to see and I tick the Clocks as appropriate. I can even “frame” them for more complex scenes (like a building about to collapse, or the progress of a marching army during a session, or an “Alarm Raised” Clock or whatever is needed).

# Clock usage


I predominantly run FitD stuff nowadays, but when I do run PbtA- my “Prep” is usually pretty simple. The “longest” part of my prep (and it usually isn’t that long) is honestly just the recap for the prior session. When I have time, I like to make it really detailed- but that isn’t always the case. Nonetheless, the recap is usually the key for getting my head into the right space for running the session.

From there? I really don’t Prep much more than that!

When it comes to Clocks, and frankly I probably don’t use Clocks as often in PbtA as opposed to FitD, the key things to remember are:

    They’re tools. The second they aren’t helping- trash ‘em (AKA “Hold On Lightly”)

    They’re transparency tools. Yes, they help me to organize my thoughts and Threats, but they’re best served as things for the players to see so we’re all on the same page. PbtA and FitD games thrive with transparency

    Because they’re transparency tools, they change nothing about actual mechanics. They are visual representations of the fiction. No more. No less. A scene where a Clock is used (whether it be for tracking overcoming a significant obstacle or counting up to a mounting threat) can be run the exact same way without a Clock. It’s all just there for visual transparency

    Because they’re used for transparency, the only time they’re needed as a visual tool is when transparency is “threatened,” usually because the whole thing is becoming really complex to track. Therefore, if it ain’t complex- it ain’t deserving of a Clock

Ironsworn has a nifty way to fill up its Progress Tracks by variable amounts (just like most FitD games). However, I find this doesn’t transfer cleanly to other PbtA games. The concept is still there (“Limited” and “Great” Effects as well as “Controlled” and “Desperate” Positions still exist in PbtA games- just not in “name” or “clock function”). So basically, I tick the Clocks one at a time in the PbtA space.

Clocks can be used for just about any complex situation that crops up during a:

    Scene: A Clock to track catching a fleeing boat or a Clock to track growing suspicion levels

    Session: A Clock to track sabotage to water wells against a marching army or a Clock to track when the gale force storms threaten the Coast Town

    Season: A Clock to track gaining the alliance of major factions or a Clock to track a villain nearing completion towards one of their nefarious schemes

Clocks come in sizes of 3, 4, 5, and 6 Segments. More Segments means it’s a more challenging obstacle to overcome or a mounting threat that’ll take longer to manifest.

At the most fundamental level: Clocks get ticked when it makes sense. For guidance:

    Scene Clocks are ticked usually as a result of individual Moves. For Clocks to track overcoming an obstacle, a 7+ makes progress, but sometimes a 6- can too. For Clocks tracking a mounting problem, a 9- makes progress… but so can a 10+!

    Session Clocks are ticked based in the trajectory of a scene. Did the scene see the PCs working towards overcoming that obstacle successfully? Tick the Clock. Did the scene see the Threat growing further? Tick the Clock.

    Season Clocks are ticked based in the trajectory of a Session. Did the Session see the PCs working towards overcoming that obstacle successfully? Tick the Clock. Did the Session see the Threat growing further? Tick the Clock.

I probably use more Season Clocks than Scene or Session Clocks in PbtA games. The function is the same as a Front- except the Grim Portents aren’t defined beforehand. In essence, I know what the Impending Doom is (the name of the Clock tells me, more often than not) and I’ll know just based on gut instinct what progress will look like when I have to tick the Clock.
